# R-Markdown
I am in the process of learning how to use R Markdown

Recently I have graduated from The University of Western Australia with a degreee of Master of Economics (NB: it's nothing special!)
I had an idea of using my old assignment and to reproduce my submission with the help of R Markdown.
I feel like it would help me understand more about this amazing feature from R that could potentially be useful for me in the future.

Feel free to have a look or download the files/dataset contained in this repository, hopefully it can be helpful.
If you have any feedbacks for me, feel free to reach out.

Thank you.

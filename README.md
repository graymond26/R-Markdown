# R-Markdown
I am in the process of learning how to use R Markdown

By using assignment, I will try to reproduce my submission with the help of R Markdown.
Feel free to have a look or download the files contained in this repository, hopefully it can be helpful.
If you have any feedbacks for me, feel free to reach out.

Thank you.

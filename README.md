# R-Markdown
I am in the process of learning how to use R Markdown.

Recently I have graduated from The University of Western Australia with a degreee of Master of Economics (NB: it's nothing special!)
I had an idea of using my old assignment and to reproduce my submission with the help of R Markdown.
I feel like it would help me understand more about this amazing feature from R that could potentially be useful for me in the future.

Feel free to have a look or download the files/dataset contained in this repository, hopefully it can be helpful.
There are four datasets in this repository:
- *wbdr.dta* is from The World Bank Development Report Data
- *worms.dta* is from Ted Miguel & Michael Kremer (2004, Econmetrica) - Worms: Identifying Impacts on Education and Health in the Presence of Treatment Externalities
- *retro.dta* and *prosp.dta* is from Paul Glewwe, Michael Kremer, Sylvie Moulin, & Eric Zitzewitz (2004, Journal of Development Economics) - Retrospective vs. prospective analyses of school inputs: the case of flip charts in Kenya

If you have any feedbacks for me or this small project, feel free to reach out.

Thank you.
